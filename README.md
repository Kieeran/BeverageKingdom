## Description
**Beverage Kingdom** is a 2D action-defense game with a vibrant summer theme, created during a 48-hour game jam.  
Players control a moving character to protect their beachside base from waves of quirky enemies.  
Instead of placing static towers, players use real-time attacks and build combos to summon reinforcements.  
The game blends light strategy and quick action into a short but energetic gameplay experience.
